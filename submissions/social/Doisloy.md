## Category
social - Community, content, messaging

## Description
ConnectChain is a decentralized social platform that enables users to share content, chat, and build communities without relying on centralized servers.  
The main focus: privacy, user data ownership, and token-based incentives.

## Problem Statement
Traditional social media platforms face several issues:
- User data is monetized without proper consent  
- Content can be censored by centralized authorities  
- Lack of fair rewards for content creators  

## Proposed Solution
- **On-chain Content**: posts and interactions stored on blockchain/IPFS.  
- **Token Reward System**: users & creators earn incentives for contributions.  
- **Wallet-based Identity Verification**: login with wallet instead of email/password.  
- **DAO-based Community Moderation**: rules governed by the community, not a centralized admin.  

## Technical Architecture
- **Frontend**: React + Next.js  
- **Backend**: Solidity smart contracts for content, voting, and rewards  
- **Storage**: IPFS for media (images, videos, documents)  
- **Integration**: SL integration for identity and verification  

## Development Timeline
- **Week 1–2**: Research & architecture design  
- **Week 3–4**: Smart contracts (posting, comments, rewards)  
- **Week 5–6**: IPFS integration & wallet-based login  
- **Week 7–8**: UI/UX development  
- **Week 9**: Internal testing  
- **Week 10**: Testnet deployment  

## Team
- doisloy (Lead Developer)  
- Contributor (UI/UX Designer)  
- Contributor (Smart Contract Auditor)  

## Expected Outcome
- A transparent, secure, and incentive-driven decentralized social application  
- A community that can freely express themselves without risk of censorship or data exploitation
